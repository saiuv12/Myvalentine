## Runtime requirements

- **Node.js**: v20 LTS or newer (recommended)
- **npm**: comes with Node.js

## Setup commands

From the `app` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # production build
npm run dev     # local development server
```

## Notes

- All JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies are defined in `package.json` and locked in `package-lock.json`.
- No additional system services (databases, queues, etc.) are required.
